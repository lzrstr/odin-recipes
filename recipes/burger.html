    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is an example description about a very delicion burger</p>
      <p>It is a standard recipe fit for every day meals</p>
    <h2>Ingridient list</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>500 g (1 lb 2 oz) regular minced (ground) beef</li>
        <li>½ cup (30 g) panko breadcrumbs </li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp cracked black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>To a large bowl, add the beef mince, breadcrumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt and pepper. Use your hands to combine well. Divide the mixture into 4–6 portions, then use your hands to form patties. Their size ideally needs to be just bigger than the burger buns you are using as the patties will shrink slightly as they cook. Want an extra veggie hit? See note 2.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use your thumb to make an indent in one side of the patty. This helps the patties keep their shape during cooking..</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan over medium–high heat. Cook the burger patties for 10–12 minutes, turning once halfway through. Add the water to the pan in the last 2 minutes of cooking. This step is optional, it allows you to scrape up all of the delicious sticky bits in the base of the pan and they cling to the outside of the patties = more flavour! For a delicious chargrilled result, you can cook the patties in a chargrill pan or cook them on a barbecue plate. Heat the plate to medium–high, spray the plate with oil just before cooking and cook the patties for 10–12 minutes, turning once halfway. </p></li>
            <li><p>Serve the brioche buns topped with burger patties, cheese, tomato, red onion, gherkins, lettuce, whole-egg mayonnaise, ketchup and American mustard. Serve immediately!</p></li>
